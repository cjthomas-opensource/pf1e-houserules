\section{Modified Spells}

%
\subsection{Ant Haul}

Per the CRB, this triple's the target's carrying capacity for land travel,
for 2~hours/level.

There is a version that's SL2 that triples the carrying capacity of a
flying creature, for 1~hour/level.
%

%
\subsection{Calm Animals}

Calm Animals works on anything with the ``animal'' or ``magical beast''
type that does not have full sapience (i.e. Int less than 3). Be advised
that most things with Int~0 are immune to mind-affecting spells due to
being mindless (they're mostly vermin or oozes or the like, not animals).
The DM can adjudicate special cases (things that are animal-like but don't
have ``animal'' or ``magical beast'' type might still be affected).
%

%
\subsection{Calm Emotions}

This spell is also available as a Wizard~2 spell.

There is a version that's SL3 that lasts 1 minute per level and does not
require concentration.

There is a SL~4 version lasting 1 round per level and a SL~5 version
lasting 1 minute per level that give targets a -5 penalty to the saves to
resist the spell.
%

%
\subsection{Charm Animal}

Charm Animal works on anything with the ``animal'' or ``magical beast''
type that does not have full sapience (i.e. Int less than 3). Be advised
that most things with Int~0 are immune to mind-affecting spells due to
being mindless (they're mostly vermin or oozes or the like, not animals).
The DM can adjudicate special cases (things that are animal-like but don't
have ``animal'' or ``magical beast'' type might still be affected).

Rather than making the caster a ``trusted friend'', this spell improves
the target's attitude towards the caster by 2 steps. That's still probably
good enough, especially if you try using Handle Animal to improve it
further immediately afterward.

There is a version that's SL3 that gives the recipient a -5 penalty to
their Will save to resist the spell.
%

%
\subsection{Charm Monster}

This spell does not exist. Use Charm Animal for non-sapient targets and
Charm Person for sapient targets.
%

%
\subsection{Charm Person}

Charm Person works on anything sapient (from a human to a unicorn to a
dragon). The target \textit{does not} need to understand your language
to be affected. Bear in mind that powerful creatures typically have very
good Will saves.

Rather than making the caster a ``trusted friend'', this spell improves
the target's attitude towards the caster by 2 steps. That's still probably
good enough, especially if you try using Diplomacy to improve it further
immediately afterward.

There is a version that's SL3 that gives the recipient a -5 penalty to
their Will save to resist the spell.
%

%
\subsection{Clairvoyance}

See notes at ``Scrying''.
%

%
\subsection{Command}

Command works on anything that can understand you. This usually means
human-level intelligence, but Speak with Animals can circumvent that that.

The command is limited to one simple action, not one word. Typical
examples might be ``drop your weapons'', ``get out'', ``go away'',
``lie down'', and so forth.
%

%
\subsection{Comprehend Languages}

Comprehend Languages with written material works by accessing the
Immaterium.

This means it will work on living languages, but won't be able to translate
dead languages (no fluent speakers within the last 50-100 years).

It also means that it can only translate codes and ciphers that are widely
known and that don't require keys or other message-specific information.

There's a SL3 version of the spell that can translate writing that only a
\textit{few} people know how to read, but the information still has to be
around somewhere.
%

%
\subsection{Daylight}

Daylight normally lasts for 10 minutes per level, but if cast on an object
made of gold (or plated in gold), it lasts for 1 hour per level.

This is sometimes used for household and industrial lighting, in the same
manner as the Light cantrip, but the Light cantrip is much more common
(since one person can cast it on a large number of lamps).
%

%
\subsection{Detect Evil}

Superseded by ``Know Alignment''.
%

%
\subsection{Dominate Animal}

Dominate Animal works on anything with the ``animal'' or ``magical beast''
type that does not have full sapience (i.e. Int less than 3). Be advised
that most things with Int~0 are immune to mind-affecting spells due to
being mindless (they're mostly vermin or oozes or the like, not animals).
The DM can adjudicate special cases (things that are animal-like but don't
have ``animal'' or ``magical beast'' type might still be affected).

This spell lasts 1 minute per caster level, and the target gets a new
saving throw each minute.

There is a Wizard~3 version of this spell.

There is a version that's SL5 that lasts 1 day per caster level, with a new
saving throw each day. It also gives the recipient a -5 penalty on the Will
save to resist the spell.
%

%
\subsection{Dominate Person}

Dominate Person works on anything sapient (from a human to a unicorn to a
dragon). Bear in mind that powerful creatures typically have very good Will
saves.

This spell lasts 1 day per caster level, and the target gets a new saving
throw each day.

There is a version that's SL7 that gives the recipient a -5 penalty on the
Will save to resist the spell.
%

%
\subsection{Endure Elements}

The ``Mass'' version of this spell is SL2, rather than the usual SL3.

%
\subsection{Expeditious Retreat}

Expeditious Retreat gives a land speed bonus equal to your base speed.
Per the CRB it's 1~minute/level and bard/wizard~1.

There is a version that's SL3 that gives a speed bonus to all movement
modes (equal to each mode's base speed).

This is slightly less useful than Haste (which is also SL3), but lasts
longer.
%

%
\subsection{Geas}

Geas works on anything sapient (from a human to a unicorn to a dragon).
The target must be able to understand you to be affected. Bear in mind that
powerful creatures typically have very good Will saves.

These spells give an instruction to do or refrain from doing some general
task or activity. There is an implicit ``to the extent that you are able''
added to instructions (pausing to eat and sleep are okay), and there is an
implicit ``to the extent that you can without it being suicide'' as well.
One or both of these is often made explicit (e.g. ``from sunrise to sunset,
six days out of seven, you will labour towards X'').

On breaking the direction, the subject is immediately Sickened and gets a
penalty to all ability scores (without delay). The penalty gets worse (by
the spell's penalty increment) every 24 hours, up to the spell's penalty
limit. This cannot reduce an ability score below 3. When the spell's
duration expires, or when the subject sincerely attempts to abide by its
terms again, symptoms reduce in severity every 24 hours (with the Sickened
condition disappearing when the last of the ability penalties do).

Instructions that are prohibitions (such as ``don't kill anyone'') usually
include terms of restitution, so killing someone in anger and then resolving
not to do it again isn't enough to remove the penalty -- the recipient has
to sincerely intend to make restitution (or to accept a pre-specified
alternate punishment) as well.

Lesser Geas is Bard~3, Cleric~4, Wizard~4.
Greater Geas is Bard~5, Cleric~6, Wizard~6.

Both spells have a casting time of 1 minute (long enough to spell out the
task or prohibition). Both spells allow a Will save; for Greater Geas, the
save has a -5 penalty. There is no hit dice limit; if an ancient dragon
fails its saving throw (and fails to kill you while you're casting the
spell), it's affected.

Lesser Geas lasts 2 days per caster level, and applies an ability score
penalty of -2 to 24 hours, to a limit of -8.

Greater Geas lasts 2 weeks per caster level, and applies an ability score
penalty of -3 per 24 hours, to a limit of -12.
%

%
\subsection{Hide from Animals}

Hide from Animals works on anything with animal intelligence or less that
could be described as a ``critter''. This includes insects, magical beasts,
and oozes, but not including undead, outsiders, or aberrations.
%

%
\subsection{Light}

Light normally lasts for 10 minutes per level, but if cast on an object
made of gold (or plated in gold), it lasts for 1 hour per level.

This is widely used for household lighting, and handheld objects with
plated fiddly-bits and reflectors are readily available in ``flashlight''
and ``lantern'' form-factors.
%

%
\subsection{Longstrider}

Longstrider gives a land speed bonus of half your base speed, rounded down
to the next multiple of 5'. Per the CRB it's 1~hour/level and
druid/ranger~1.

There is a version that's SL2 that gives a speed bonus to all movement
modes (equal to half each mode's base speed, rounded down per above).
%

%
\subsection{Magic Fang}

Magic Fang works as-described in the CRB (giving +1 to a single natural
weapon).

There is a version that's SL2 that affects all natural weapons.

Greater Magic Fang works on all natural weapons and gives a scaling bonus
(+1 per two full levels, to a maximum of +5).
%

%
\subsection{Nondetection}

There is a ``Greater'' version of Nondetection that increases the DC by
5, and is also more effective at degrading scrying. See notes at
``Scrying''. Greater Nondetection is Wizard~5.
%

%
\subsection{Scrying}

Sending and Scrying can operate at long range, but are limited by
interference from high-background areas (with a useful range of 100-200
miles). The spells can also be attenuated by lead.

Signal levels are Decent, Degraded, Very Bad, and None.

There are higher-level (``Greater'') versions of Sending, Scrying, and
Clairvoyance that operate more effectively. These are two levels higher
than the corresponding standard spells.

Certain spells (or enchanted devices with those spells) at the target can
be used to enhance the signal. These are used as communications aids (for
Sending) and for espionage (Scrying and Clairvoyance). See ``Sending Focus''
and ``Scrying Focus'' for details.

Summary of spells and countermeasures affecting signal:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}\hline
\textbf{Effect} & \textbf{Conditions} \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
%

%
\subsection{See Alignment}

Superseded by ``Know Alignment''.
%

%
\subsection{See Invisible}

In addition to seeing invisible things, the user can also see through
illusions of the ``figment'' or ``glamer'' type, such as those produced by
Disguise Self or Minor Image. The user perceives both the illusion and
whatever's under the illusion, and knows which is which.

Illusions of the ``pattern'' type (such as Colour Spray) are identified as
illusions but still do their thing (mind-affecting).

Illusions of the ``phantasm'' type (all in your head) function normally.

Illusions of the ``shadow'' type (conjuring in shadow-matter) are
identified as what they are (typically resulting in reduced damage).
%

%
\subsection{Sending}

This has a casting time of 1 minute, rather than 10 minutes.

The recipient of a ``Sending'' call can choose to reject the call. The
person making the call can't tell if the all was rejected or if the
contact attempt failed for some other reason.

See also the notes at ``Scrying''.
%

%
\subsection{Suggestion}

Suggestion works on anything that can understand you. This usually means
human-level intelligence, but Speak with Animals can circumvent that that.
Bear in mind that powerful creatures typically have very good Will saves.

%
\subsection{Bardic Masterpiece: Scare}

Flavoured as ``Terrifying Tale'' or ``Haunting Melody'' or similar.

Prerequisite: Perform (6 ranks)

Cost: Buy it with a feat, or as a L3 Bard spell.

Effect:

At the end of the round in which you initiate the performance, a set of
targets that you specify must make a Will saving throw. On failure, the
creatures become Frightened; on success, they become Shaken. You can affect
a number of targets equal to your Charisma modifier. Targets must be able
to hear and understand your performance.

When the performance ends, affected creatures may make new saving throws.
Saving throws are made at the start of a creature's turn. A successful
save ends the condition. Attempts may be made each round until successful.

Use:

2 Bardic Performance rounds to initiate, plus 2 Bardic Performance rounds
per target per round that the effect is maintained. This includes the
round in which the performance is initiated.

For purposes of computing the save DC, this is a L2 effect (not L3).
%

%
\subsection{Binding Contract}

Cleric~3, Wizard~3

V/S/M, one living creature, indefinite, n/a save (see below)
Material component is 5000~sp worth of diamonds.

Casting time is anywhere from a few rounds to several minutes; it involves
reading out the contract and making sure it's understood.

This spell enforces the terms of a contract on the recipient. The recipient
must understand and willingly agree to abide by the terms of the contract
for the spell to take effect; no saving throw is made (they voluntarily
failed it). If the recipient does not agree to be bound by the contract,
the spell is expended but the material components are not.

The recipient has a general idea if a given action or inaction would break
the contract; this makes it hard to accidentally break it.

The contracting parties both know the current compliance state and are
updated about changes to compliance.

Immediately upon breaching the terms of the contract, the recipient is
Sickened, and gets a -2 penalty to all ability scores (without delay).
The penalty gets worse (by -2) every 24 hours, to a maximum of -8. This
cannot reduce an ability score below 3. The penalty remains until
restitution for all outstanding breaches is made. When no outstanding
breaches remain, symptoms reduce in severity every 24 hours (with the
Sickened condition disappearing when the last of the ability penalties do).

Terms of restitution for breaches are usually spelled out in the contract.
The person who offered the contract can forgive the recipient of one or
more breaches at their discretion.

The contract remains in force indefinitely, irrespective of whether
penalties have occurred and of whether breaches are outstanding or forgiven.
The contract ends when the recipient dies (which the offerer immediately
knows about), or when the person who offered the contract explicitly ends
the contract or dies (both of which the recipient immediately knows about).

There is a version that's SL~5 that affects a number of recipients up to
the caster level (with one set of shared terms). The material component for
this version of the spell is \mbox{20,000~sp} worth of diamonds (beakeven
point vs the SL~3 spell is 4 recipients).

The Harbourton version of this spell traditionally involves reading out the
offered terms, asking ``do you understand the offer?'', and then asking
``do you agree to this contract?''. Replying ``yes'' to both completes the
spell.

\subsection{Detect Background}

Cleric 0, Druid 0, Wizard 0

This tells the caster what the level of background magic around them is
(none, low, medium, high, or extreme).
%

%
\subsection{Know Alignment}

Bard 1, Cleric 1, Wizard 1

60' cone, concentration 1 minute/level, Will negates

This spell produces an emanation similar to that of ``Detect Thoughts''.
The caster can focus on any person that they can see or otherwise perceive
within the target area, and learn about their world-view on the good/evil
and law/chaos axes.

Information starts off very vague and gets more precise with continued
inspection (up to 3 rounds).
%

%
\subsection{Padded Weapon}

Cleric 1, Wizard 1

touch, 1 weapon or 10 projectiles, 1 hour per caster level

This makes a normally-lethal weapon function deal nonlethal damage.

The damage type becomes ``bludgeoning'', and the damage die size is
reduced by one step (1d8 becomes 1d6, etc).

Most versions of this spell cause a visible aura around the weapon, so
that people on the receiving end know that they are being attacked with
nonlethal force. This spell is widely used for police work.

It is normally more cost-effective to buy a purpose-built nonlethal weapon,
but when flexibility is desired, this spell provides a nonlethal option.
%

%
\subsection{Protection from Background}

Cleric 1, Druid 1, Ranger 1, Wizard 1

touch, 24 hours, Will negates (harmless)

This protects a person from background magic, reducing its effective
strength by one step.

The ``Mass'' version is SL2, rather than the usual SL3.

There is a version that's SL2 that reduces the effective background
strength by two steps. The ``Mass'' version of that spell is SL3.
%

%
\subsection{Scrying Focus}

Druid 2, Cleric 2, Wizard 2

touch, 24 hours, Will negates

This makes a person, place, or object easier to target with the ``Scrying''
and ``Clairvoyance'' spells, per notes at ``Scrying''.

There is a ``Greater'' version at SL4 that is even more effective.
%

%
\subsection{Sending Focus}

Cleric 2, Wizard 2

touch, 24 hours, Will negates

This makes a person, place, or object easier to target with the ``Sending''
spell, per notes at ``Sending''. Signal quality is improved, mitigating
interference.

There is a ``Greater'' version at SL4 that is even more effective.
