\section{Modified Spells}

%
\subsection{Ant Haul}

Per the CRB, this triple's the target's carrying capacity for land travel,
for 2~hours/level.

There is a version that's SL2 that triples the carrying capacity of a
flying creature, for 1~hour/level.
%

%
\subsection{Clairvoyance}

See notes at ``Scrying''.
%

%
\subsection{Comprehend Languages}

Comprehend Languages with written material works by accessing the
Immaterium.

This means it will work on living languages, but won't be able to translate
dead languages (no fluent speakers within the last 50-100 years).

It also means that it can only translate codes and ciphers that are widely
known and that don't require keys or other message-specific information.

There's a SL3 version of the spell that can translate writing that only a
\textit{few} people know how to read, but the information still has to be
around somewhere.
%

%
\subsection{Daylight}

Daylight normally lasts for 10 minutes per level, but if cast on an object
made of gold (or plated in gold), it lasts for 1 hour per level.

This is sometimes used for household and industrial lighting, in the same
manner as the Light cantrip, but the Light cantrip is much more common
(since one person can cast it on a large number of lamps).
%

%
\subsection{Detect Evil}

Superseded by ``Know Alignment''.
%

%
\subsection{Endure Elements}

The ``Mass'' version of this spell is SL2, rather than the usual SL3.

%
\subsection{Expeditious Retreat}

Expeditious Retreat gives a land speed bonus equal to your base speed.
Per the CRB it's 1~minute/level and bard/wizard~1.

There is a version that's SL3 that gives a speed bonus to all movement
modes (equal to each mode's base speed).

This is slightly less useful than Haste (which is also SL3), but lasts
longer.
%

%
\subsection{Light}

Light normally lasts for 10 minutes per level, but if cast on an object
made of gold (or plated in gold), it lasts for 1 hour per level.

This is widely used for household lighting, and handheld objects with
plated fiddly-bits and reflectors are readily available in ``flashlight''
and ``lantern'' form-factors.
%

%
\subsection{Longstrider}

Longstrider gives a land speed bonus of half your base speed, rounded down
to the next multiple of 5'. Per the CRB it's 1~hour/level and
druid/ranger~1.

There is a version that's SL2 that gives a speed bonus to all movement
modes (equal to half each mode's base speed, rounded down per above).
%

%
\subsection{Magic Fang}

Magic Fang works as-described in the CRB (giving +1 to a single natural
weapon).

There is a version that's SL2 that affects all natural weapons.

Greater Magic Fang works on all natural weapons and gives a scaling bonus
(+1 per two full levels, to a maximum of +5).
%

%
\subsection{Nondetection}

There is a ``Greater'' version of Nondetection that increases the DC by
5, and is also more effective at degrading scrying. See notes at
``Scrying''. Greater Nondetection is Wizard~5.
%

%
\subsection{Scrying}

Sending and Scrying can operate at long range, but are limited by
interference from high-background areas (with a useful range of 100-200
miles). The spells can also be attenuated by lead.

Signal levels are Decent, Degraded, Very Bad, and None.

There are higher-level (``Greater'') versions of Sending, Scrying, and
Clairvoyance that operate more effectively. These are two levels higher
than the corresponding standard spells.

Certain spells (or enchanted devices with those spells) at the target can
be used to enhance the signal. These are used as communications aids (for
Sending) and for espionage (Scrying and Clairvoyance). See ``Sending Focus''
and ``Scrying Focus'' for details.

Summary of spells and countermeasures affecting signal:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}\hline
\textbf{Effect} & \textbf{Conditions} \\ \hline
%
baseline & Sending (C4/W5), Scrying (D4/C5/W5), Clairvoyance (W3) \\
\hline
%
+1 signal & Greater version of the spell. \\
+1 signal & Sending or scrying focus at the target. \\
+2 signal & Greater focus at the target. \\
\hline
%
-1 signal & Lead foil. \\
-2 signal & Heavy lead plates. \\
-2 signal & Nondetection (W3) (Scrying/Clairvoyance only). \\
-3 signal & Heavy multi-layer shielding. \\
-4 signal & Greater Nondetection (W5) (Scrying/Clairvoyance only). \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
%

%
\subsection{See Alignment}

Superseded by ``Know Alignment''.
%

%
\subsection{See Invisible}

In addition to seeing invisible things, the user can also see through
illusions of the ``figment'' or ``glamer'' type, such as those produced by
Disguise Self or Minor Image. The user perceives both the illusion and
whatever's under the illusion, and knows which is which.

Illusions of the ``pattern'' type (such as Colour Spray) are identified as
illusions but still do their thing (mind-affecting).

Illusions of the ``phantasm'' type (all in your head) function normally.

Illusions of the ``shadow'' type (conjuring in shadow-matter) are
identified as what they are (typically resulting in reduced damage).
%

%
\subsection{Sending}

This has a casting time of 1 minute, rather than 10 minutes.

The recipient of a ``Sending'' call can choose to reject the call. The
person making the call can't tell if the all was rejected or if the
contact attempt failed for some other reason.

See also the notes at ``Scrying''.

\subsection{Bardic Masterpiece: Scare}

Flavoured as ``Terrifying Tale'' or ``Haunting Melody'' or similar.

Prerequisite: Perform (6 ranks)

Cost: Buy it with a feat, or as a L3 Bard spell.

Effect:

At the end of the round in which you initiate the performance, a set of
targets that you specify must make a Will saving throw. On failure, the
creatures become Frightened; on success, they become Shaken. You can affect
a number of targets equal to your Charisma modifier. Targets must be able
to hear and understand your performance.

When the performance ends, affected creatures may make new saving throws.
Saving throws are made at the start of a creature's turn. A successful
save ends the condition. Attempts may be made each round until successful.

Use:

2 Bardic Performance rounds to initiate, plus 2 Bardic Performance rounds
per target per round that the effect is maintained. This includes the
round in which the performance is initiated.

For purposes of computing the save DC, this is a L2 effect (not L3).

\subsection{Detect Background}

Cleric 0, Druid 0, Wizard 0

This tells the caster what the level of background magic around them is
(none, low, medium, high, or extreme).
%

%
\subsection{Know Alignment}

Bard 1, Cleric 1, Wizard 1

60' cone, concentration 1 minute/level, Will negates

This spell produces an emanation similar to that of ``Detect Thoughts''.
The caster can focus on any person that they can see or otherwise perceive
within the target area, and learn about their world-view on the good/evil
and law/chaos axes.

Information starts off very vague and gets more precise with continued
inspection (up to 3 rounds).
%

%
\subsection{Padded Weapon}

Cleric 1, Wizard 1

touch, 1 weapon or 10 projectiles, 1 hour per caster level

This makes a normally-lethal weapon function deal nonlethal damage.

The damage type becomes ``bludgeoning'', and the damage die size is
reduced by one step (1d8 becomes 1d6, etc).

Most versions of this spell cause a visible aura around the weapon, so
that people on the receiving end know that they are being attacked with
nonlethal force. This spell is widely used for police work.

It is normally more cost-effective to buy a purpose-built nonlethal weapon,
but when flexibility is desired, this spell provides a nonlethal option.
%

%
\subsection{Protection from Background}

Cleric 1, Druid 1, Ranger 1, Wizard 1

touch, 24 hours, Will negates (harmless)

This protects a person from background magic, reducing its effective
strength by one step.

The ``Mass'' version is SL2, rather than the usual SL3.

There is a version that's SL2 that reduces the effective background
strength by two steps. The ``Mass'' version of that spell is SL3.
%

%
\subsection{Scrying Focus}

Druid 2, Cleric 2, Wizard 2

touch, 24 hours, Will negates

This makes a person, place, or object easier to target with the ``Scrying''
and ``Clairvoyance'' spells, per notes at ``Scrying''.

There is a ``Greater'' version at SL4 that is even more effective.
%

%
\subsection{Sending Focus}

Cleric 2, Wizard 2

touch, 24 hours, Will negates

This makes a person, place, or object easier to target with the ``Sending''
spell, per notes at ``Sending''. Signal quality is improved, mitigating
interference.

There is a ``Greater'' version at SL4 that is even more effective.
