\subsection{Arcane Training}

Prerequisite: Int 10+

You have basic training in arcane spellcasting without being a career
wizard. You know three wizard cantrips (and only those three), which you
can prepare and cast as a wizard would.

Taking this feat multiple times gives more cantrips known but does not
provide more spell slots. Multiclassing into wizard likewise only provides
the total number of cantrip spell slots you'd get as a wizard.

\subsection{Combat Awareness}

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Wis 13+

You are able to quickly recognize dangerous situations. If you are
surprised in combat, you are only considered flat-footed by opponents who
beat your initiative roll.

\subsection{Formation Fighting}

Prerequisite: base attack bonus +1

When leading a formation, you receive a +2 bonus to all morale rolls
involving your troops. In addition, if a simple majority of the unit's
members have this feat, the following effects apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item All unit members receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
\item The front rank receives a +1 bonus to AC.
\item Ranks behind the front rank receive a +4 bonus to AC.
\end{itemize}

\textit{NOTE - This was intended for use with Tony's mass combat system.
It still works well enough with my system (one roll for each group of
combatants).}

\subsection{Inspired Artist}

Prerequisites: appropriate Craft or Profession 1, Wis 13+

You are gifted in creative works. When you make a Craft or Profession roll
involving creation of a new composition (unique and with artistic merit),
you receive a +2 bonus to the Craft or Profession roll, and you have a
higher-than-normal income multiplier (exact value at the DM's discretion;
typically doubling income for an early-career character).

\subsection{Martial Tutelage}

Prerequisite: base attack bonus +2, Formation Fighting,
suitable noble title or military rank

You are expected to be able to wage war and lead troops in a military
campaign, and you have been extensively trained in doing so. You receive
a +2 competency bonus to checks regarding leading troops (such as morale
checks), stacking with the bonus from Formation Fighting (if individual
unit leaders have it). In addition, as long as you are actively directing
your forces (i.e. lines of communication are open), all forces under your
control receive a +2 bonus to their initiative.

You have basic training in druidic spellcasting without being a career
druid. You know three druid orisons (and only those three), which you can
prepare and cast as a druid would.

Taking this feat multiple times gives more orisons known but does not
provide more spell slots. Multiclassing into druid likewise only provides
the total number of orison spell slots you'd get as a druid.
